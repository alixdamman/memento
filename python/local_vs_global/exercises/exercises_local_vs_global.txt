Exercise 0: create an new empty project

* create an empty project called “python_workshop” (in c:\usr\)
* copy all files & directories from <desktop>/python_workshop/ to c:\usr\python_workshop.
  You should have at least:
  - a directory /input with two Excel files,
  - a directory /output,
  - 4 modules "exercise_X_global.py" where X = 1, 2, 3 and 4


# ====== Global non-array variables - Exercise 1 ======

Exercise 1: knock knock jokes

  a) Open "exercise_1_global.py" module and read the code.
     This Python script is supposed to print 3 different "knock knock" jokes
     but there is something wrong in the code.
  b) Find and explain what is wrong in the code.
  b) Modify the functions so as the "print(joke)" statements print
     the "knock knock" jokes as expected.
     - Do not move the print statement into functions!
     - Do not remove functions!


# ====== Global non-array variables - Exercise 2 ======

Exercise 2: using global non-array variables in a model

  a) Open "exercise_2_global.py" module and read the code.
     There is something terribly wrong in this script.
  b) Find and explain what is wrong in the code.
  c) Modify the code so as it does what it is expected to do.


# ====== Global array variables - Exercise 3 ======

Exercise 3: using global array variables in functions

  a) Open "exercise_3_global.py" module and read the code.
     We propose 5 different functions to fill a global array "pop" with a given value.
     Some are correct and some are not.
     The use of different functions are activated through "run_function" flags.
  b) Set to True the "run_function" flags associated with correct ways of
     modifying global arrays inside a function.
     If you don't choose well, the program will crash...


# ====== Global array variables - Exercise 4 ======

Exercise 4: using global array variables in a model

  a) Open "exercise_4_global.py" module and read the code.
     There is something horribly wrong in this script.
  b) Find and explain what is wrong in the code.
  c) Modify the code so as it does what it is expected to do.
